# MD the docker manager script 

## What is this 

This is a shell script that manages docker for the user in the command line. That i made for me and that is made to benefit me but shared with the rest of the world. Others may use it if they wish
however im not responisble for what happen to your machine if you run this keep that in mind. 

## In Progress
Also this script is still a work in progress and there is still alot to be done. An there is alot 
i have in mind to change,remove,add,and overrall improve in this.

## Requiremwents 
- First you need docker to use this script (I am working on integrating this into the script :))

- An also you need git which you can install with your package manager whatever you use. 


## How to use this
- First you need to make it executable so run this 
`chmod +x md`

- Then symbolic link it to `/usr/local/bin` like this 
`sudo ln -s /path/ /usr/local/bin` 

- Then Run the script like this 
`md` Also you need root to run it you can use sudo

- If you dont use root then it will give an error so run with sudo 

## Finally 
This script is a work in progress. There is a lot to do and a lot to work on. There is a lot of plans for this project. Releases happen Monthly so there will be a new release every month. There is a
lot i want i want to do especially in this repo i want to add a wiki and a lot of stuff. However 
this is it for right now.
